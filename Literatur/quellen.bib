	doi = {10.1109/FOCS52979.2021.00069},
	abstract = {For a complexity class \$C\$ and language \$L\$, a constructive separation of \$L {\textbackslash}notin C\$ gives an efficient algorithm (also called a refuter) to find counterexamples (bad inputs) for every \$C\$-algorithm attempting to decide \$L\$. We study the questions: Which lower bounds can be made constructive? What are the consequences of constructive separations? We build a case that "constructiveness" serves as a dividing line between many weak lower bounds we know how to prove, and strong lower bounds against \$P\$, \${ZPP}\$, and \${BPP}\$. Put another way, constructiveness is the opposite of a complexity barrier: it is a property we want lower bounds to have. Our results fall into three broad categories. 1. Our first set of results shows that, for many well-known lower bounds against streaming algorithms, one-tape Turing machines, and query complexity, as well as lower bounds for the Minimum Circuit Size Problem, making these lower bounds constructive would imply breakthrough separations ranging from \${EXP} {\textbackslash}neq {BPP}\$ to even \$P {\textbackslash}neq {NP}\$. 2. Our second set of results shows that for most major open problems in lower bounds against \$P\$, \${ZPP}\$, and \${BPP}\$, including \$P {\textbackslash}neq {NP}\$, \$P {\textbackslash}neq {PSPACE}\$, \$P {\textbackslash}neq {PP}\$, \${ZPP} {\textbackslash}neq {EXP}\$, and \${BPP} {\textbackslash}neq {NEXP}\$, any proof of the separation would further imply a constructive separation. Our results generalize earlier results for \$P {\textbackslash}neq {NP}\$ [Gutfreund, Shaltiel, and Ta-Shma, {CCC} 2005] and \${BPP} {\textbackslash}neq {NEXP}\$ [Dolev, Fandina and Gutfreund, {CIAC} 2013]. 3. Our third set of results shows that certain complexity separations cannot be made constructive. We observe that for all super-polynomially growing functions \$t\$, there are no constructive separations for detecting high \$t\$-time Kolmogorov complexity (a task which is known to be not in \$P\$) from any complexity class, unconditionally.},

Alternation links up time and space complexities rather well, in that alternating polynomial time equals deterministic polynomial space, and alternating linear space equals deterministic exponential time. Such considerations lead to a two-person game complete in polynomial time, and other games complete in exponential time. We also find that computability on a parallel processing machine is a rather rugged notion, and present two parallel processing models that are polynomially equivalent in their running times. We also show that while n-state alternating finite automata accept only regular sets that can be accepted by 22n-O(logn) state deterministic automata, alternating pushdown automata accept all languages accepted by Turing machines in deterministic exponential time.},
